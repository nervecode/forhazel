                <p>Hello, my love. It's been another month of ups and downs but I'm still head over heels for you.
                    I'm so glad you're still here with me even though I know that you're tired. We survived another
                    month,
                    a month full of sadness, misunderstandings, anxieties, pressures, stress, and more negative emotions
                    that we feel to be exact.
                    even with these challenges we are facing, I pray for you not to give up, again. I know they're times
                    I'm an unnecessary for you or
                    unimportant. I pray those negative emotions you feel towards me will soon be faded. Sorry if
                    sometimes I'm acting like a child,
                    begging for your attention 24/7, sorry kung makulit ako, that is just how I'm feeling because I'm
                    comfortable with you,
                    it actually hurts when you say you feel awkward around me or you're being uncomfortable:( <span
                        class="green">I
                        miss you.</span>
                    Baby, Hon, Mahal I don't wanna see u feeling the regrets beside me. I don't know what hurts the
                    most. Your approach or those regrets or...
                    giving you so many reasons to leave me. for real, I don't want to lose you:( I feel like I'm tied,
                    I feel that everytime you say that you don't want me,.. I know you want me. Your words tells me but
                    your actions oppose.
                    But you know baby sometimes I think I'm just being convinient to you kaya medj napipilitan ka pero I
                    know I've been bad for you because seeing you right know is of course, worst. Tell me if I said
                    anything that I mustn't be feeling.
                    Myself tells me not to leave you but instead hug you for what you're now. If I can't embrace these
                    part of you,
                    myself tells how can I marry you? how can I build a future with you, a family?
                    Sometimes I realised giving you something is not a way that you want, but my way for you,
                    I mean it's part of my love language that I thought if I'd be like that everything will be fine,
                    I didn't see other important details of your wants.
                    I didn't understand clearly I just know you're here with me but didn't even give you enough reason
                    to stay.
                    Let's say you're very thankful for it, but possible if you're hoping for something that is prolly on
                    poor scale HAHAHAAHAHAH
                    yun lang kasi problema sakin or satin mag kaiba tayo nang nakikita. Nagsisisi naman ako.
                    What if dukutin ko tig isa nating mata tapos exchange djk. I didn't only want you, I want to keep
                    you, keep you only in me.
                    I know I deserve this but never in my mind tells me not to love you but to love you more and deeply.
                    I don't hold any grudges from you instead I feel lucky. Lucky to have someone who can say what kind
                    of person I am.
                    I'm even willing to give myself to you anytime you want it u can get it, it's yours. Happy 1219 Days
                    with you, my love.
                    I love you beyond everything, I'd love to see a never ending seconds, minutes, hours, days for us.
